# AidData Visualization: Geo,Time & Network Analysis
In this project, I have used D3.js to engineer a comprehensive dashboard that answers various questions about global AidData.

**Dataset Used** : [AidData Dataset](https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1) 

In the AidData dataset, each row represents a financial transaction between two countries. The dataset contains the following attributes:
* Year: year of the commitment
* Donor: country providing the financial resource
* Recipient: country or organization receiving the money
* Commitment Amount: the total amount of financial resources provided
* Coalesced Purpose Name: the purpose of the transaction

Below is an example of the data:
